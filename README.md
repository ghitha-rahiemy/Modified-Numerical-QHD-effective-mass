This repository contains the codes I wrote for my undergraduate thesis. Most of the codes are modified from [this notebook](https://github.com/manishprasad0/Computational-Nuclear-Physics/blob/main/10.%20Quantum%20Hadrodynamics.ipynb), along with the mathematical derivations adapted from Serot and Walecka (1986).

The full article using this code can be found here: [Rahiemy et al. (2025)](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2509.10176)
